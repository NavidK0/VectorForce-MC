This is an old Spigot minigame that I made back when I made Minecraft plugins.

The objective of this game was to race on a procedurally generated track based on some WorldEdit schematic templates. It was the beginning of my "procedurally generated" gamedev phase.
Yes, it contained copyrighted music, no, it was never distributed.

Bear in mind, it is highly unlikely this will function these days since it relied on a lot of "hacks" and used a Browser Web Client to stream music to the player. However, it's cool to look back at it. It was truely a unique minigame in its day -- perhaps I will turn it into a real game someday.

CAVEAT:

## Yes, this is definitely not as clean as it could or should be.
